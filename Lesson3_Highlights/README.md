## Project Description:
(This assingment taught me different types of version control systems, including GIT. In the lesson, they taught me the background of GIT and how it records snapshots of the previous versions of the shared files, and is an easier way for a team to colloborate simutaneoulsy on the same file. They also emphasized you don't need to be a coder to know how to use this system and is simple for the every day worker to use. )

## Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. The major difference between GIT and other VCS is the way GIT thinks about its data. GIT thinks of its data like a series of snapshots of a miniature filesystem. GIT takes a picture of what all your files look like at the moment a user commits or saves the state of their project.
2. You can obtain a GIT repository in two ways. One, you can take a local directory that is currently not under version control, and turn it into a GIT repository, or, you can clone an existing GIT repository from elsewhere.
3. Each file in your working directory can be in one of two states, tracked or untracked. Tracked files are files that were in the last snapshot, they can be unmodified, modified, or staged. Untracked files are the files that GIT doesn't know about.
