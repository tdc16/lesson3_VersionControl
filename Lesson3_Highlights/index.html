            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version Control is when you have one main repository for all of the project files. Team members can check files out, make changes, and then check them back in. A main advantage is it solves the file sharing problem. The VCS automatically notes numerous activities. For example, who changed the files, when they were changed, what about them is now different, and all the changes are merged to the same file. There are many benefits to the VCS. Files can not be over written, team members are able to work on the same file simutaneously, and revert the file to a previous version.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">GIT</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">GIT is a distributed version control system that has several benefits. For example, every user has a complete copy of the repository data stored locally on their machine, everything is local, processes run faster, and prevents unintentional overwriting. The major difference between GIT and other VCS is the way GIT thinks about its data. GIT thinks of its data like a series of snapshots of a miniature filesystem. GIT takes a picture of what all your files look like at the moment a user commits or saves the state of their project. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">GIT Repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">You can obtain a GIT repository in two ways. One, you can take a local directory that is currently not under version control, and turn it into a GIT repository, or, you can clone an existing GIT repository from elsewhere. If you have an exisitng file you would like to control with GIT, start in the project's directory and use the command ".git". If you want to get a copy of an existing GIT repository, you would use the command "git clone". GIT receives a full copy of nearly all data that the server has. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Recording Changes to the Repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Each file in your working directory can be in one of two states, tracked or untracked. Tracked files are files that were in the last snapshot, they can be unmodified, modified, or staged. Untracked files are the files that GIT doesn't know about. They are any files in your working directory that were not in your last snapshot and are not in your staging area.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Value of GIT</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">GIT is a fast and modern implementation of version control. GIT provides a history of content changes. GIT facilitates collaborative changes to files. Lastly, GIT is easy to use for any type of knowledge workers, not just coders. </p>
